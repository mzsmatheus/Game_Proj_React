## Guess the Word Game
# 📁 Description:
**This little game is my first project in React, it is a "Guess the Word" game with words of various categories made following the React course from Matheus Battisti on Udemy.**

# 🛠️ How to play:
**Press the "Play" button and a hint about the category of the word will show up on the screen, as well as the quantity of slots relative to the letters of the word. You have 3 chances to guess what word was picked, your total score is displayed at the top of the screen, and the letters used at the bottom. Once you reach 0 chances, you're sent to the "GAME OVER" screen where you can hit the button to try again!**
